This is my portfolio site hosting on github. This site contains six major pages, including Home, About, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact. It was implemented with hand-coded **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, and **Foundation.** The Skills has the Search and SortBy functions which are implemented with **Angular JS**. The Projects includes Dashboard tab, Responsive Web Design tab, and Fundamental Web Design tab to show some of the projects that I worked on. It is responsive and mobile-friendly.

Thank you for visiting.
